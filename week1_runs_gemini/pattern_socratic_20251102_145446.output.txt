Here are 3 questions designed to encourage deep, interdisciplinary thinking about the societal impact of AI:

1. **The Sovereignty Shift:** If AI systems become provably superior decision-makers (in terms of efficiency, optimization, and lack of human bias) across critical domains like law, resource allocation, and urban planning, **to what extent should we prioritize democratic human sovereignty and the right to make flawed decisions, versus delegating control to the optimized algorithmic authority?** (Consider the ethical and psychological impact of knowing our social structures are optimized but not *ours*.)

2. **The Definition of Work and Worth:** As Generative AI and advanced automation accelerate the obsolescence of many knowledge-worker roles and dramatically decouple productivity from human hours, **how must society fundamentally redefine the concept of "contribution" and "worth" to ensure psychological stability and economic inclusion for individuals whose primary value creation has been automated?** (Focus beyond basic income and consider necessary changes to education, social status, and communal purpose.)

3. **The Mirror of Intelligence:** When AI reaches a generalized level of sophistication, it will not just perform tasks; it will reflect our implicit biases, cultural narratives, and historical data patterns with frightening accuracy. **What essential human institutions (e.g., academia, journalism, ethics boards) must be radically overhauled, and how, to effectively monitor, interrogate, and mitigate the complex and often invisible influence AI has on shaping the collective perception of reality?** (Consider how we vet "truth" when the source of information is an inscrutable black box trained on everything.)
