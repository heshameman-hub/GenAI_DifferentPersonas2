### Notes on Usage:

1.  **Timing:** Wait until the stated deadline for a decision has passed, or at least 1-2 weeks after the interview. This email is often sent in conjunction with a general follow-up asking about the next steps.
2.  **Recipient:** This should be sent to the primary contact or the main interviewer (usually the Hiring Manager).
3.  **Tone:** Keep the tone appreciative, brief, and focused on self-improvement, which makes the request less demanding.
4.  **Expectation:** Be prepared that many companies (especially large ones or those concerned about legal liability) may decline to provide detailed feedback.
