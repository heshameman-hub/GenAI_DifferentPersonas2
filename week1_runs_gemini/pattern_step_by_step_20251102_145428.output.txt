Here is a step-by-step reasoning of what happens to water when it is heated to $100^\circ\text{C}$ at sea level:

### Step 1: Define the Initial Conditions
*   **Substance:** Water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$).
*   **Initial State:** Likely liquid (unless specified otherwise, heating implies starting below the boiling point).
*   **Temperature Reached:** $100^\circ\text{C}$.
*   **Pressure:** Standard atmospheric pressure at sea level (approximately 1 atmosphere or 101.325 kPa).

### Step 2: Define Key Physical Constants (Boiling Point)
*   The **boiling point** is the temperature at which a substance changes from a liquid to a gas (vapor) throughout the bulk of the liquid.
*   For pure water, the boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure (sea level) is **$100^\circ\text{C}$ ($212^\circ\text{F}$)**.

### Step 3: Analyze the Process Leading Up to $100^\circ\text{C}$
*   As the water is heated from room temperature (e.g., $20^\circ\text{C}$) up toward $100^\circ\text{C}$, the liquid water absorbs thermal energy.
*   This absorbed energy increases the kinetic energy of the water molecules, causing the temperature of the liquid to rise.

### Step 4: Analyze the Event at $100^\circ\text{C}$
*   When the water reaches $100^\circ\text{C}$ at sea level pressure, the vapor pressure of the liquid water becomes equal to the external atmospheric pressure.
*   This condition initiates **boiling**.

### Step 5: Describe the Observable Phenomenon (Boiling)
*   The water undergoes a phase transition (vaporization).
*   Large bubbles of water vapor form throughout the volume of the liquid, rise quickly to the surface, and burst, releasing steam (gaseous water) into the atmosphere.

### Step 6: Determine the Final State
*   If heating continues past the point where $100^\circ\text{C}$ is reached, the temperature of the water **will not rise** above $100^\circ\text{C}$ until **all** the liquid water has converted into steam.
*   All the added heat energy (the latent heat of vaporization) is used solely to break the intermolecular bonds and complete the phase change.

### Conclusion

When water is heated to $100^\circ\text{C}$ at sea level pressure, the water **begins to boil** (or is actively boiling). It undergoes a phase change from liquid water to gaseous water (steam).
